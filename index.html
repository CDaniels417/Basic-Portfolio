            <p>  
                I am a proud father to twin girls, Talia and Tiara. I've worked many in many fields
                from Retail to Techical Support for a income tax preparation software, yet never felt
                like those were my calling until I stumbled upon Web Development. I was tasked to build a
                site for a business platform my employer was unveiling for new clients. I researched 
                quite a few solutions for this request and found that wordpress and wix did not allow me
                the creativity that wanted and the user interface was quite tidious, then I decided to learn
                web development in order to create a better oppurtunity for myself to further advance in my career.
                By divine intervention I searched for web development courses and found the UM Coding BootCamp program
                and decided to enroll.
